## Remote C2 mini-PC login / access

In order to login to the C2 remotely which is located in Nick Hubchak's home
we will be using a RDP connection brought to us by windows. First thing is to
download the Windows RDP interface: [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12)<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12>

The MRD (Microsoft Remote Desktop) is an app that can be downloaded on any
personal machine including: MacOS, Windows, Android, IOS.

Once downloaded and installed you can open the screen and hit the plus button
to add a new PC, in the hostname field (first top field) add this domain name:

### eagleenterprisesc2.ddns.net

then hit the (x) and it should save the pc hostname in a small window. Click on
that window.

Window should open and start connection and promt you for username and password,
enter this:

### username: <EagleForUsC2@outlook.com>

### password: EagleEnterprisesC2


then continue with the login. Now you should be good to go :), you should see mission planner and all the development stuff to work with and feel free to download more stuff if you need it.


##We have now aquired and setup a new C2 machine that will be used during demo day.
Below are the instructions on how to login and setup the connection:

First login to outlook using the below creditials:
EagleForUsC2@outlook.com
EagleEnterprisesC2

Next go download [Team Viewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/download/windows/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=us%7Cb%7Cpr%7C22%7Caug%7Ctv-core-download-sn%7Cnew%7Ct0%7C0&utm_content=Download&utm_term=teamviewer+download) for windows, mac, android, or IOS (mobil version call it team viewer remote connection or something)

Once downloaded login:
EagleForUsC2@outlook.com
EagleEnterprisesC2

Then the app might send a link to the outlook email to confirm that your device is safe to access the remote device, go to other time with email for outlook open and click on the recent email to verify device

Then the screen should look similar to :

From there enter the Parner ID:
421 881 604

Click "Remote Control" if it prompts for password type in:
EagleEnterprisesC2

From there you should have controll of C2.

If the C2 is not accesible that means someone from Motown did not leave the laptop pluged in and in standby mode, so it might be the machine is turned off and we cannot access it remotely until someone re-sets the machine up

##To re-setup machine

Login to C2 and plug into outlet turn brightness down and leave screen slightly tilted but not closed. The C2 might go to sleep on its own but thats ok. Leave machine and do not shut screen. Make sure machine is in a safe place.
