## Remote C2 mini-PC login / access

In order to login to the C2 remotely which is located in Nick Hubchak's home
we will be using a RDP connection brought to us by windows. First thing is to
download the Windows RDP interface: [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12)<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12>

The MRD (Microsoft Remote Desktop) is an app that can be downloaded on any
personal machine including: MacOS, Windows, Android, IOS.

Once downloaded and installed you can open the screen and hit the plus button
to add a new PC, in the hostname field (first top field) add this domain name:

### eagleenterprisesc2.ddns.net

then hit the (x) and it should save the pc hostname in a small window. Click on
that window.

Window should open and start connection and promt you for username and password,
enter this:

### username: <EagleForUsC2@outlook.com>

### password: EagleEnterprisesC2

then continue with the login. Now you should be good to go :), you should see
mission planner and all the development stuff to work with and feel free to
download more stuff if you need it.
